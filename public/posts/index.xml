      <description>&lt;p&gt;one time i told someone i was autistic&#xA;and she said, don’t say that about yourself!&#xA;oh. ok.&#xA;to be fair, that was before i became&#xA;an official, card-carrying autist&#xA;certified, verified, bona fide&#xA;i can show you my credentials&#xA;see this paper right here?&#xA;F84.0 Autism Spectrum Disorder&#xA;it took me 27 years to earn that&#xA;i am very proud!&#xA;i believe the doctor’s exact words were&#xA;there’s definitely something going on there&#xA;after i did too well on the adhd test&#xA;to get a prescription for uppers&#xA;but still managed to check off every trait in the DSM V&#xA;when i was in grade school&#xA;the other kids would say i was an alien&#xA;and it really did feel like it sometimes&#xA;…oftentimes&#xA;it turns out i’m a real earthling after all&#xA;i just didn’t get the built-in user manual&#xA;that most other humans apparently come with&#xA;i have to gingerly feel my way through existence&#xA;hoping i do the right things&#xA;and don’t do the wrong things&#xA;because people aren’t always empathetic&#xA;when something like how to know it’s time to leave&#xA;is right there in chapter 7, section C, line 2&#xA;but i’m still sitting there as they awkwardly smile&#xA;and common phrases that actually mean something else entirely&#xA;are in a bulleted list on pages 194-197&#xA;i have to scribble everything down as i figure it out&#xA;and hope i don’t annoy anyone too much in the process&#xA;most of my life i felt defective&#xA;but mostly these days i find it pretty neat&#xA;that i get to perceive the world in a slightly different way&#xA;and i make a point of observing and finding out&#xA;all the ways other people experience the world&#xA;because there’s really no default perspective&#xA;and reality is a bit fuzzy on the edges when you look close enough&#xA;and maybe it’s all a bit of everything all at once&#xA;and all of our infinite configurations&#xA;work together to show off&#xA;all the infinite facets of the universe&#xA;and i think that’s pretty cool&lt;/p&gt;</description>

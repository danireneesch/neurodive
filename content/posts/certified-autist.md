one time i told someone i was autistic

and she said, don’t say that about yourself!

oh. ok.

to be fair, that was before i became

an official, card-carrying autist

certified, verified, bona fide

i can show you my credentials

see this paper right here?

F84.0 Autism Spectrum Disorder

it took me 27 years to earn that

i am very proud!

i believe the doctor’s exact words were

there’s definitely something going on there

after i did too well on the adhd test

to get a prescription for uppers

but still managed to check off every trait in the DSM V

when i was in grade school

the other kids would say i was an alien

and it really did feel like it sometimes

…oftentimes

it turns out i’m a real earthling after all

i just didn’t get the built-in user manual

that most other humans apparently come with

i have to gingerly feel my way through existence

hoping i do the right things

and don’t do the wrong things

because people aren’t always empathetic

when something like how to know it’s time to leave

is right there in chapter 7, section C, line 2

but i’m still sitting there as they awkwardly smile

and common phrases that actually mean something else entirely

are in a bulleted list on pages 194-197

i have to scribble everything down as i figure it out

and hope i don’t annoy anyone too much in the process

most of my life i felt defective

but mostly these days i find it pretty neat

that i get to perceive the world in a slightly different way

and i make a point of observing and finding out

all the ways other people experience the world

because there’s really no default perspective

and reality is a bit fuzzy on the edges when you look close enough

and maybe it’s all a bit of everything all at once

and all of our infinite configurations

work together to show off

all the infinite facets of the universe

and i think that’s pretty cool
